Algorithms of  NLP
Once the data has been preprocessed, an algorithm is developed to process it in a rules-based system. This system uses carefully designed linguistic rules. 
Tokenization 
1. Stopwords :    for preprocessing 
2. Part-of-Speech Tagging :    Named Entity Recognition , Coreference Resolution, Speech Recognition
3. Chunking -     grouping pos tags into some meaningful chunks 
4. Chinking -     removing extra words from chunks
5. Named Entity Recognition -     location, date ,person
6. Text Classification :     To categorise words into predefined classes like articles , web pages using Bag of Words
7. Naive Bayes-     used for Sentiment analysis
8. Topic modeling :     to generate meaning full insights from the similar words in the entire corpus of words 
9. Word Net -      large database to find relation like synonyms, similarities 
10. Lemmatization -     process of obtaining root word
11. Stemming -      used to find root word
12. Word as Feature -     Tokens are converted into bolean , numerical so that mathematical model can understand the pattern and insights of it .
13. Text summarization : Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling 
14. Sentiment Analysis - we use sentiment _module.py to find sentiment of the sentences like pos 1.0, neg 0.6 
15. Saving model : Pickle is used for saving classifier using pickle.dump
